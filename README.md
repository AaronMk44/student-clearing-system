# Student Clearing System

The Student Clearing System is an online platform designed to facilitate the clearance process for students in an educational institution. It allows students to create clearance forms and submit them for approval by administrators. The system has three primary actors: the Student, the Administrators, and the Super Administrator.

## Actors

1. **Student**: The main user of the system, the student visits the online platform to create a clearance form and request clearance from the administrators.

2. **Administrators**: There are several administrators in the system who review and approve the clearance requests submitted by students. The administrators include:

   - Faculty Coordinator: This administrator oversees the academic clearance process and ensures that students meet the necessary academic requirements.

   - Hostel Representative: Responsible for reviewing clearance requests related to hostel accommodations, ensuring that students have settled any outstanding dues or issues.

   - Accountant: Deals with financial clearance, verifying that students have cleared all outstanding fees and financial obligations.

   - Librarian: Reviews the clearance requests related to library resources, ensuring that students have returned all borrowed items and resolved any library-related matters.

3. **Super Administrator**: The Super Administrator is the highest-level administrator in the system, responsible for managing user profiles and granting access to students and other administrators. They create profiles for new students and administrators or add existing ones to the system.

## Workflow

1. The student accesses the online Student Clearing System and creates a clearance form. This form includes information about the student's academic progress, hostel accommodation, financial status, and library resources.

2. The student submits the clearance form for review by the administrators.

3. The administrators, including the Faculty Coordinator, Hostel Representative, Accountant, and Librarian, browse through the clearance form.

4. If the student meets all the clearance conditions set by each administrator, they proceed with approving the form.

5. If the student fails to meet any of the clearance conditions, the clearance request is denied, and the student is notified of the outstanding requirements.

6. For a student or administrator to access and use the Student Clearing System, the Super Administrator must create their profile or add them to the system. The Super Administrator manages user accounts and grants appropriate access levels.
